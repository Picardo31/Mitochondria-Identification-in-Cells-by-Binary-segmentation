The application of CNN is based on the identification of the mitochondria within a eukaryotic cell that make up the smallest part of animals, plants and fungi.
The Mitochondria is a eukaryotic cell organelle responsible for supplying most of the energy necessary for cellular activity through the process called cellular respiration. They act as power plants of the cell and synthesize ATP, and contain DNA.
The Mitochondria identification could help to clasify and identify with time medical disorders as 0Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Leigh, etc.
